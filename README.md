# PublicSoftCodingProjectFrontEnd

### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

-This is the frontend implementation of Public Soft Coding Project and was written in Angular.

-Download the project and extract the files

-Navigate inside the main folder of it where the "src" subfolder is, copy this path (eg. C:\etc\etc\src) , open the shell (command prompt in Windows OS), move to the path (tip: write in the command prompt "cd <path>" and press Enter), then type "ng serve -o" and press Enter. The frontend part should be working and should see it after some seconds in you browser.

-The application runs on http://localhost:4200/ but if you want to change port (maybe is being used) type in the previous step  "ng serve -o --port=<port that you want eg. 4205>"
